## âœ… Checklist

### 1. Identify Components
- [ ] Look for functions that return JSX â€” those are components.
- [ ] Note the main/root component (usually `App`) and any child components.

### 2. Check State and Props
- [ ] Look for `useState`, `useEffect`, and props passed into components.
- [ ] Ask: *What data does this component track or receive?*

### 3. Read the JSX Return
- [ ] Scan the `return()` block to see whatâ€™s rendered.
- [ ] Look for dynamic expressions (`{}`), conditionals, and loops.

### 4. Find Event Handlers
- [ ] Look for functions tied to events like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.
- [ ] Ask: *What happens when the user interacts?*

### 5. Trace Data Flow
- [ ] Follow how props move from parent to child.
- [ ] Follow how state changes trigger re-renders.

### 6. Check Execution Readiness
- [ ] Make sure each function has the data it needs.
- [ ] Look for missing props, undefined state, or broken logic.
